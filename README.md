Veil
====

A sass library for rapid development based off of Bootstrap(specifically based on sass-bootstrap) with a focus on keeping design code out of your markup

About
====

This library is designed to give you the power of bootstrap elements while properly secluding your design from your structure.

Goals
=====
The goal for this project is to replace as much of the bootstrap library as possible with sass based logic. Code designed to take parameters will be converted to @mixin(s) and any code that does not will be @extend(ed).
